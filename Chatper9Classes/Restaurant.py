# 9-1. Restaurant: Make a class called Restaurant . The __init__() method for
# Restaurant should store two attributes: a restaurant_name and a cuisine_type .
# Make a method called describe_restaurant() that prints these two pieces of
# information, and a method called open_restaurant() that prints a message indi-
# cating that the restaurant is open.
# Make an instance called restaurant from your class. Print the two attri-
# butes individually, and then call both methods.

# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162).
# Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. Create an
# instance called restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number
# of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and
# print the value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment
# the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any num-
# ber you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a
# day of business.

# in Exercise 9-1 (page 162) or Exercise 9-4 (page 167). Either version of
# the class will work; just pick the one you like better. Add an attribute called
# flavors that stores a list of ice cream flavors. Write a method that displays
# these flavors. Create an instance of IceCreamStand , and call this method
