# the name of the new person you are inviting.

# dinner table.
# • Use insert() to add one new guest to the beginning of your list.

# 3-7. Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t

# message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.
# • Use pop() to remove guests from your list one at a time until only two
# names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print
# a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite
# them to dinner.
# • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them
# know they’re still invited.
# • Use del to remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty
# list. Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end
